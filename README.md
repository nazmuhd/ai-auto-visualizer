## 🛠️ Getting Started: Local Development

This application is designed to run directly in a browser environment that supports ES modules and provides the necessary API key.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
-   A Google Gemini API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
-   A local web server to serve the `index.html` file. You can use extensions like VS Code's "Live Server".

### Setup & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-auto-visualizer.git
    cd ai-auto-visualizer
    ```

2.  **Set up the API Key:**
    The application expects the Google Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`. The execution environment (like Google's internal development platform) is responsible for injecting this variable. For local testing, you would need to simulate this environment or modify the code in `services/ai/client.ts` to temporarily hardcode your key (not recommended for production).

3.  **Run the application:**
    Serve the project's root directory using a local web server. For example, using the "Live Server" extension in VS Code, you can right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

    The application will open in your browser.

## 🌐 Deployment

This project is a static web application and can be deployed to any static hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).

1.  **Build Step:** No build step is required as the app uses browser-native ES modules and an import map to load dependencies from a CDN.
2.  **Environment Variables**: Ensure your hosting provider is configured to provide the `API_KEY` environment variable to the application runtime.
